# Filebox
This simple python script was created to help me with my website development as the college network didn't have a ftp client on hand.

A Python Based Tkinter File Transfer Protocol Client. This Client Allows Users To Download And Upload Files In A Structured Way. The Python Script Makes Use Of Ftplib Aswell As Other Libraries That Comes Standard With Python. The App Allows The User To View, Delete, Upload And Navigate Through A File Server.

This Script Does Not Make Use Of Any External Libraries That Doesn't Come With Python 3
