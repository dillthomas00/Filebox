# Filebox
This simple python script was created to help me with my website development as the college network didn't have a ftp client on hand.

A python based tkinter file transfer protocol client. This client allosw users to download and upload files in a structured way. The python script makes use of ftplib aswell as other libraries that comes standard with python. The app allows the user to view, delete, upload and navigate through a file server
